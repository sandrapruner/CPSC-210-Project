# My Personal Project
My personal project will be a type of personalized
wishlist for books with information on libraries. 
Think of a library website, where you can place books 
on hold, etc. but combined with multiple libraries 
near you, and customized for a user-based, **not**
 library-based experience. The application will store
a wish-list of books, and track whether you want to
read/are reading/have read each book. Will include a 
list of libraries the book is at, and whether it is 
checked out/in the library. Depending on how it goes,
I may want to include a calendar which shows date 
checked out/due date/date finished reading. It could
also have a way of recommending different books in a 
dataset based off of a book you like.
# Who and Why
Anyone who wants to make a wishlist of books, or even
just check out a book from a library could use this
application. Personally I would use a combination of 
all its uses, although maybe not the calendar. I have
always found library websites finicky and hard to use, 
and have disliked traditional book apps such as 
*GoodReads*. This application would combine all the 
useful information for library books into **one**.
